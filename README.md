# elm-audio-app

This is a basic template repository for building Web Audio applications in Elm.
It uses my own `elm-web-audio` package for creating audio graphs inside of Elm
and `parcel-bundler` to build the application.

Pull requests are very welcome!

## Installing
Clone the repository and run `npm install` (This means you need node/npm installed first!).

## Developing
Run `npm run dev` to spin up a development server with hot realoding.

## Building
Run `npm run build` to compile everything into the dist/ directory.
